	<h2> Edward Ding </h2>
</div>


I'm a diligent programmer who loves coding and design. However I'm not that kind of typical geek who seems never get out of their room. I love sports, I love travelling, and I love music as well. Believe it or not, I'm kind of expert in playing saxophone. 

I'm an undergratuate in `BIT` now, and plan to go to America for my MS degree. Hope that `UCB` wil provide an offer to me. I love that school so much.

I'm interested in ***Machine Learning***, and have taken part in the some projects from labs at school and `NLPR, CASIA`. Recently, I've just developed an Classifier for iOS based on CNN and Caffe framework, you can check it out at my Github site under [iOSClassifier](https://github.com/EdwardDing/iOSClassifier). However, it is only a demo, so please don't treate it as a complete App.

###Experience

----------------

<h4>Internship @ National Bureau of Statistics of People’s Republic of China</h4>
I’ve been involved in testing the software for CPI data collecting. Also, I’ve been taking part in developing the ‘Automatic Generating System for ten-day reports’, which can automatically turn an EXCEL file into a descriptive WORD file in the sense of natural language.

<h4>Internship @ Chinese Academy of Science (NLPR, CASIA)</h4>

I was in charge of developing classifier for mobile terminal (iOS). This project relate to Deep Learning and Pattern Recognition. It is a little bit like the project I took in Dr. Xiabi Liu’s lab. But this time, we are using Convolutional Neural Network Algorithm (CNN). The project is based on Caffe framework developed by UCB.
