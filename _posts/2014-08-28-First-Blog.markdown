Hello World :]

I'm `Edward Ding`

This place gonna be my new home for blogging.

Since I don't know what to publish on this first blog, I'll just note down a quote from `Steve Jobs` heard from the Ted Radio Hour. It's very intersting!

During an interview in 1996, he was askted to share his view on **innovation**.

> JOBS: I mean, Picasso had a saying. He said, good artists copy, great artists steal. And we have, you know, always been shameless about stealing great ideas.

Fast-forward 14 years later, 2010, when Google's android phone started to challenge Apple's iPhone. `Steve Jobs` was quoted saying this.

>  I'm going to destroy android because it's a stolen product. I'm willing to go thermal nuclear war on this. Ok, so in other words, great artists steal, but not from me.

That is really masterpiece.
