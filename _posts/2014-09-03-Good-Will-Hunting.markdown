> Sean: So if I asked you about art, you'd probably give me the skinny on every art book ever written. Michelangelo? You know a lot about him. Life's work, political aspirations. Him and the pope. Sexual orientation. The whole work, right? I bet you can't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chape. You never actually stood there and looked up at the beautiful ceiling. Seeing that.

> Sean: If I ask you about women, you'll probably give me a syllabus of your personal favorites. You may have been laid a few times. But you can't tell me what it feels like to wake up next to a woman and feel truly happy.

> Sean: I ask you about war, you'd probably throw Shakespeare at me, right? "Once more into the breach, dear friends." But you've never been near one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watching him gasp his last breath looking at you for help.

> Sean: If I asked you about love, you'd probably quote me a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable. Known someone that could level you with her eyes. Feeling like God put an angle on Earth just for you, who could rescue you from the depths of hell. And you wouldn't know what it's like to be her angel, to have that love for her be there forever. Through anything. Through cancer. And you wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two month, holding her hand, because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term "visiting hours" don't apply to you.

> Sean: You don't know about real loss because that only occurs when you love something more than you love yourself.

> Chuck: Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way. But in 20 years if you're still living here, coming over to my house to watch the Patriots games, still working construction, I'll fucking kill ya. That's not a threat. That's a fact. I'll fucking kill ya.

> Will: What's the fuck are you talking about?

> Chuck: Look, you got something none of us have.

> Will: Oh, come on. Why is it always this? I fucking owe it to myself to do this or that. What is I don't want to?

> Chuck: No, no, no. You don't owe it to yourself. You owe it to me. Because tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be 50, and I'll still be doing this shit. That's all right, That's fine. I mean, you're sitting on a winning lottery ticket. You're too much of a pussy to cash it in, and that's bullshit, because I'd do fucking anything to have what you got. So would any of these guys. Be an insult to us if you're still here in 20 years. Hanging around here is a fucking waste of your time.

> Chuck: Let me tell you what I do know. Every day I come by your house, and I pick you up. We go out have a few drinks and few laughs, and it's great. You know what the best part of my day is? It's for about ten seconds: from when I pull up to the curb and when I get to your door, because I think maybe I'll get up there and I'll knock on the door and you won't be there. No "good-bye", no "see ya latter". No nothing. You just left. I don't know much, but I know that.

> Will: Sean, if the professor calls about that job, just tell him sorry, I had to go see about a girl.

> Sean: Son of a bitch. He stole my line.
