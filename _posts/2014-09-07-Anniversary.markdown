excerpt: Anniversary with my lovely bunny
---

Been with my girlfriend for one full year. Flowers are ready, cakes are ready, presents are ready. Just waiting for my beautiful gril to coming :)

Tomorrow will be the Lunar's Festival in China, as well as our anniversary day for being together. As tomorrow I have to do some preparation for the new semester as well as some other trifles, we decided to celebrate on the day before Sep. 8, which becomes today. 

Now, I am sitting in Starbucks, having a Cappuccino and waiting for my girl.

Gee, the cake from `Black Swan Luxury` is really good. And the the service is pretty nice. Guess what, I've seen a wedding cake as expensive as ï¿¥999,999.00!!
