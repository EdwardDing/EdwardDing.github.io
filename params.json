It's verying intersting!\r\n\r\nDuring an interview in 1996, he was askted to share his view on **innovation**.\r\n> JOBS: I mean, Picasso had a saying. He said, good artists copy, great artists steal. And we have, you know, always been shameless about stealing great ideas.\r\n\r\nFast-forward 14 years later, 2010, when Google's android phone started to challenge Apple's iPhone. `Steve Jobs` was quoted saying this.\r\n\r\n>  I'm going to destroy android because it's a stolen product. I'm willing to go thermal nuclear war on this. Ok, so in other words, great artists steal, but not from me.\r\n\r\nThat is really masterpiece.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
